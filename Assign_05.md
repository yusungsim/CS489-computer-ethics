Basic income is a regular amount of payment for every individual without any discrimination or requirement. [CitizensIncome.org](https://citizensincome.org/citizens-income/what-is-it/) defines basic income by five distinct conditions: it should be payed unconditionally, automatically, by non-withdrawble means, individually, and as a right of citizenship. The most important characteristic from this definition is that basic income must be payed unconditionally and equally, not depending on gender, employment status, family structure, or anything else.

The objective of basic income system is to support citizen's basic needs. This shares most parts with objectives of many other welfare systems, but the main difference is unconditional payment. Welfare systems that supports basic needs set conditions for receivers, to target those who are in difficult situation and need special kind of supports. [National pension system of South Korea](https://www.gov.kr/portal/service/serviceInfo/PTR000051902) supports seniors over 60, the disabled, and the bereaved.

Althought the idea was brought long ago, the actual implementation of basic income has short history. The idea was originated from Thomas More's Utopia, where every social members get guaranteed payment. The experiement of basic income in reality was first conducted from mid 20th century. For example, in the Unites States and Canada, [negative income tax experiments](https://web.archive.org/web/20091206014715/http://www.irp.wisc.edu/research/nit/NIT_index.htm) were conducted from 1960s to 1970s, but was never adopted as a actual policy. For recent example, [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/) is currently supporting poor families in East Africa by similar means of basic income.

Today, universal basic income have become a hot issue again. Famous technicians, economists and politicians like Elon Musk, Milton Friedman, and Bernie Sanders is supporting universal basic income as a feasible future policy. The U.S. 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang have pledged to implement [the Freedom Dividend, a universal basic income of $1000 per month](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/). As Yang became a popular candidate, the idea of basic income is being relighted.

Why Basic Income should be Policy
---

Currently, there are many arguments regarding universal basic income as a national policy for every citizen. One main argument from advocate of basic income is that the policy will directly help people in extreme povery. Because basic income provides everyone with minimum amount of money required for living, the proponents argue that those in extreme poverty can sustain themselves or their family and focus on job developement. There are several study results supporting and refuting this claims. In the report, [Universal Basic Income - A Report for Unions](http://www.world-psi.org/sites/default/files/documents/research/en_ubi_full_report_2019.pdf) in 2019, which contains a research result conducted for Public Sevices International aruges that [basic incomes does not improve life conditions nor sustainable in long term](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/06/universal-basic-income-public-realm-poverty-inequality), pointing out that previous experiements are resulted in failure or conducted for too short time. A report from International Labour Office also points out that [sustainable and sufficient UBI scheme will cost 30% of GDP](https://www.social-protection.org/gimi/RessourcePDF.action?id=55171), which is an extremely high cost for a nation to pay.

In contrast, a [research from GiveDirectly which is published on the Quaterly Journal of Economics](https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/publications/Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.pdf), reported that their basic income experiment in Kenya have made positive impacts on assets, earnings, food security, psychological well-being, etc. [Basic income experiement in Madhya Pradesh, India by UNICEF](http://unicef.in/Uploads/Publications/Resources/pub_doc83.pdf) resulted in improvement on economic status, housing, sanitation, food poverty, health and schooling. As various results of basic income experiments differ, we can not guarantee universal basic income policy will success or not just by now. In my opinion, there are strong evidences that basic income policies help those in poverty to improve their life status and get better chance to improve their conditions, as shown in results of the experiments. In utilitarian perspective, adopting basic income policy will certainly result in positive impact on citizen's life in overall.

Others also argue that basic income can reduce the gap between increase in productivity and hourly compensation. From 1979 to 2018, net productivity in America has increased 69.9%, while [hourly pay only increased by 11.6%](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/). This means that over time, gap between the rich and the poor have increased, which became one of important social problems today. By increasing taxation from high earners and businesses and distributing it as a form of universal basic income, this gap can be decreased. Although this approach requires careful adjustment of tax and income numbers, I believe that basic income can be one feasible way to solve the problem of economic inequlities.

Finally, automation and AI have close relationship with today's discussion on basic income. [A 2016 report from the White House](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf) predicted that 83% low-earning workers will lose their jobs to machines due to automation, thus increasing unemployment rate and poverty problem worldwide. Because technological unemployment problem will sustain and be accelerated until near future, many technicians, including [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/18/elon-musk-automated-jobs-could-make-ubi-cash-handouts-necessary.html) and [Chris Hughes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/17/facebook-co-founder-chris-hughes-on-basic-income-for-working-poor.html), claim that basic income policy will be necessary. I also agree that technological unemployment will be serious problem in near future, and basic income as a national policy will be an option for the solution.

Welfare not as an Income, but Social Capital
---

Although I generally agree that universal basic income as a policy is a feasible solution for economic inquality and technological unemployment problem, I also agree that the cost is unrealistically high. In my opinion, the amount of basic income must not only cover basic human needs like food, health and housing, but also social requirements like parenting, compulsory and vocational education, cost for social activities, and basis of self realization. Post-modern nations must be responsible for their citizen's social demands and environments. As mentioned earlier, even considering cost for only basic need resulted in 30% of GDP, adopting basic income as a long-term policy for general social structure is indeed unsustainable and unrealistic.

Instead of fulfilling basic need only with money, I think that national investment on social captial would be better option for a policy. [Social capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital) refers to factors and resources emerged from social interactions of a group. Here, investment of social captial means investment on social environment for citizens to better access on other members or entities by their needs.

People have distinct resources and needs as a modern social member, and society have their own social capitals and limitations. Because there are various types of resources and needs, which is even hard to categorize, social captial is difficult to measure exactly in number. I believe this is the main reason that cost of basic income seems unfeasible. Considering these various factors altogether and measuring as an income does not take social resources and members that individuals are able to access. Some have more access to social resources and other members, while others have less access so they have less chance to improve their life and social status. Instead of solving this by basic income policy, investment on social captial will be more efficient and feasible solution. For example, encouraging careers related to early parenting and education will enable families in poverty to have access on childminder and thus have more chance to focus on improving family status. Like this, specifying social problem and solving it by investing on social capital can have same improvement like basic income, with possibly less cost. In wider sense, welfare system in a social interaction level would be implementation of investment on social capital.

In conclusion, investment on targeting social problems and restructuring social capitals will be more realistic policy than universal basic income, consdiering the diversity of the present society. It is also true that certain amout of basic income is effective solution on solving poverty problem. For policy makers, it would be their important responsibility to make balance between basic income and targetted welfare system to provide sustainable and improving society together.
