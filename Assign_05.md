Basic income is a regular amount of payment for every individual without any discrimination or requirement. [CitizensIncome.org](https://citizensincome.org/citizens-income/what-is-it/) defines basic income by five distinct conditions: it should be payed unconditionally, automatically, by non-withdrawble means, individually, and as a right of citizenship. The most important characteristic from this definition is that basic income must be payed unconditionally and equally, not depending on gender, employment status, family structure, or anything else.

The objective of basic income system is to support citizen's basic needs. This shares most parts with objectives of many other welfare systems, but the main difference is unconditional payment. Welfare systems that supports basic needs set conditions for receivers, to target those who are in difficult situation and need special kind of supports. [National pension system of South Korea](https://www.gov.kr/portal/service/serviceInfo/PTR000051902) supports seniors over 60, the disabled, and the bereaved.
