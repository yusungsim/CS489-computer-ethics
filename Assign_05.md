Basic income is a regular amount of payment for every individual without any discrimination or requirement. [CitizensIncome.org](https://citizensincome.org/citizens-income/what-is-it/) defines basic income by five distinct conditions: it should be payed unconditionally, automatically, by non-withdrawble means, individually, and as a right of citizenship. The most important characteristic from this definition is that basic income must be payed unconditionally and equally, not depending on gender, employment status, family structure, or anything else.

The objective of basic income system is to support citizen's basic needs. This shares most parts with objectives of many other welfare systems, but the main difference is unconditional payment. Welfare systems that supports basic needs set conditions for receivers, to target those who are in difficult situation and need special kind of supports. [National pension system of South Korea](https://www.gov.kr/portal/service/serviceInfo/PTR000051902) supports seniors over 60, the disabled, and the bereaved.

Althought the idea was brought long ago, the actual implementation of basic income has short history. The idea was originated from Thomas More's Utopia, where every social members get guaranteed payment. The experiement of basic income in reality was first conducted from mid 20th century. For example, in the Unites States and Canada, [negative income tax experiments](https://web.archive.org/web/20091206014715/http://www.irp.wisc.edu/research/nit/NIT_index.htm) were conducted from 1960s to 1970s, but was never adopted as a actual policy. Recently, [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/) is currently supporting poor families in East Africa by similar means of basic income.

Today, universal basic income have become a hot issue again. Famous technicians, economists and politicians like Elon Musk, Milton Friedman, and Bernie Sanders is supporting universal basic income as a feasible future policy. The U.S. 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang have pledged to implement [the Freedom Dividend, a universal basic income of $1000 per month](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/). As Yang became a popular candidate, the idea of basic income is being relighted.
